# Mathematica to FEniCS

Goal of this project is to help solve partial differential equations written in Mathematica with FEniCS.

The goal is not to provide full interface to FEniCS from Mathematica but only make the process of transferring equations from Mathematica to FEniCS python easier.

The reason for this package is following. I can write down the equations in Mathematica easily but then writing them down in python can be pain. This can be especially true when I have system of many equations. Also Mathematica provides nice functions how to transform equations to different curvilinear coordinates systems and I do not want to rewrite them down in python by hand.
